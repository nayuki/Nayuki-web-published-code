# Data conventions: A point is a pair of floats (x, y). A circle is a triple of floats (center x, center y, radius).

# 
# Returns the smallest circle that encloses all the given points. Runs in expected O(n) time, randomized.
# Input: A sequence of pairs of floats or ints, e.g. [(0,5), (3.1,-2.7)].
# Output: A triple of floats representing a circle.
# Note: If 0 points are given, None is returned. If 1 point is given, a circle of radius 0 is returned.
# 
# Initially: No boundary points known
